# MATLAB-Toolboxes
These are scripts/packages I have downloaded from the MathWorks File Exchange and have found useful in my day-to-day research activities. This repo has been updated for use with MATLAB 2017b and later.

## [MFquestdlg](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/31044-specifying-questdlg-position)
A script for creating dialog boxes that can be set in specific positions

## [computeCohen_d](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62957-computecohen_d-x1-x2-varargin)
A simple script for computing Cohen's D

## [distinguishable_colors](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29702-generate-maximally-perceptually-distinct-colors)
A script to create a set n colors that are distinctly different from each other for easy visualizations

## [errorbar_groups](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47250-pierremegevand-errorbar_groups)
Easy script for grouping bar graphs with error bars.

## [export_fig](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export_fig)
A very slick script for converting MATLAB image files into high-res figures.

## [fix_xticklabels](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42137-fix_xticklabels-automatically-convert-xticklabels-to-multiple-line-format)
A package for fixing multi-line x tick labels

## [getkey](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7465-getkey)
Very useful script for detecting key strokes on the keyboard

## [mPraat](https://fu.ff.cuni.cz/praat/)
I honestly don't remember where I use this. I think it was something I was looking into, but decided not to use.

## praatBatching
I made these scripts! This package also includes a copy of Praat so you never need to worry about paths on your machine. Maybe I should write some documentation for this...

## [shadedErrorBar](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26311-raacampbell-shadederrorbar)
Super slick script for creating a shaded region representing the range of error values in a time-series aggregate

## [sort_nat](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10959-sort_nat-natural-order-sort)
Very useful script for sorting lists in natural way. See the link for what I mean.

## [speech_rand_noise](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/55701-speech-spectrum-shaped-noise)
Script I used to generate the Speech-Shaped Noise (SSN) for experiments that required it.

## [speechres](https://caisq.github.io/)
This is Audapter. Configured and portabale for all your speech perturbations needs
